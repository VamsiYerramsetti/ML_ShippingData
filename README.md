# ML_ShippingData

This project was an internship assighnment I did for Shipping Technologies, a company that builds autonomous vessels based in Rotterdam.

I was asked to analyze one week’s worth of sensor data from a single inland barge ship of length 136
meters and do the following:
1. Understand and preprocess the data.
2. Build and train the data on a model.
3. Predict the rot − realised (rotational acceleration) in a time-series approach.
4. Evaluate the model
5. Report the findings.
